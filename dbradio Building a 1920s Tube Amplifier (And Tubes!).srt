1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,790
put it in my ears

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:24,840
[Music]

3
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,960
okay so today we will be showing how to

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,140
construct a 1920s style tube amplifier

5
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,140
including

6
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,620
making the tubes for it

7
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,840
this was a really fun project and I

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,879
think it turned out really good

9
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,340
so please enjoy

10
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,379
okay so we are going to start the

11
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,420
construction by making the base stems

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,879
for the two tubes here's an example

13
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,140
right here

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,940
you can see it has copper leads coming

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,840
out of the bottom to connect to the tube

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,180
and those are spot welded with a tiny

17
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,239
piece of nickel to a piece of tungsten

18
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,299
wire that forms the actual hermetic seal

19
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,180
and then up here there is a piece of

20
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,939
Steel that welds to the tungsten that we

21
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,100
connect to inside the tube

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,860
so let's just get started on making that

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,580
okay so we have our copper wires here

24
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,360
and we have our strip of nickel and what

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,220
we do is we just put this on the end

26
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,140
like that

27
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,640
then we take our cutters

28
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:44,579
okay so it's now time to weld on our

29
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,680
tungsten wire that's going to make the

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,159
actual seal in the glass I'm using 0.24

31
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,479
millimeter tungsten wire

32
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,100
and I just polished that to a mirror

33
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,600
finish using 220 grit sandpaper

34
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,420
and we are just going to weld like a

35
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,520
centimeter or so

36
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,060
to each one of these and cut it off

37
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,660
all right

38
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,360
okay so we're now going to make the top

39
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,739
part that's going to go inside the tube

40
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:25,500
I have this piece of Steel that I heated

41
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,840
up in the flame to

42
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,760
outgass it I'm just gonna

43
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,900
okay so we got these made now we're

44
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,879
going to weld them on

45
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:45,800
but first we're going to

46
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,879
just very gently

47
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,200
crimp the ends

48
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,959
just a little bit to put a little flat

49
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,220
spot on there

50
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,840
to make it easier to weld

51
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,580
okay so that's what the electrodes are

52
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,260
going to look like

53
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,379
now we can get started on actual glass

54
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,239
work we're going to have to make the

55
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,220
flare that these pinch into

56
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:44,860
[Music]

57
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:12,940
[Music]

58
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,359
[Music]

59
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,740
foreign

60
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,040
[Applause]

61
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,830
[Music]

62
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,960
[Applause]

63
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,220
[Music]

64
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,000
foreign

65
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,919
so we have our two flares

66
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:25,280
and now we have to expand the glass out

67
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,240
such that we can fit our wires

68
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,919
foreign

69
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,960
foreign

70
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:41,940
now before we conceal

71
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,639
these wires in the pinches we just made

72
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,639
we have to make a oxide coating on the

73
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,620
surface of the tungsten

74
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,139
in order to create a hermetic seal in

75
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:53,759
the glass

76
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,620
and to do that we're just going to heat

77
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,860
these in the torch on low heat

78
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,419
and then we're going to clean it off

79
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,539
with a little bit of flux remover and

80
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,160
then we're going to heat it up one more

81
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,020
time just to drive off any remaining

82
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,600
solvent and I've had pretty good luck

83
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,060
with that giving me the correct seal

84
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,300
color

85
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,479
foreign

86
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:42,460
[Applause]

87
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,960
foreign

88
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:10,670
[Laughter]

89
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,580
okay that's what it's going to look like

90
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,800
now we just have to seal it in the glass

91
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:52,820
[Applause]

92
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,360
foreign

93
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,570
[Applause]

94
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,880
foreign

95
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,480
[Music]

96
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,340
[Applause]

97
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,920
okay I'll wait for that to cool and I'll

98
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,040
take a look at the seal color

99
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,279
foreign

100
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,560
okay so I ended up making a few

101
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,459
different seals here's one of them

102
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,500
I just have it in this tube filled with

103
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,560
acetone because it gives us a bit of

104
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,600
magnification so it can get a better

105
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,779
look

106
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,519
and you can see right at the bottom

107
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,740
right here we have the correct seal

108
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,000
color

109
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
and that would work you only need a

110
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,240
millimeter or two of that correct golden

111
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,980
color of the tungsten to make a good

112
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,740
seal but it's really not ideal we would

113
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,660
really like to use that entire length of

114
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,980
wire

115
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,540
so I gave it another shot

116
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,820
got this seal

117
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,079
see that one's better use about half the

118
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,899
tungsten this one we use pretty much all

119
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:00,180
of it that one these are about halfway

120
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,339
up there

121
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:03,480
like

122
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,279
if you're able to

123
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,480
get the whole length

124
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,820
that's really really what you want to

125
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,560
aim for uh

126
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,240
having the seal that looks like this

127
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,279
with the correct color going all the way

128
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,380
you can be a hundred percent sure that

129
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,440
that's not going to leak whatsoever that

130
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,720
having the text in this correct color is

131
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,120
pretty much the best way to make sure

132
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,459
that you have a good seal through the

133
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,700
glass

134
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,860
okay so we're going to start

135
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,800
constructing the tube elements now

136
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,519
cut these off

137
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,360
so this one on the end is going to be

138
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,399
the plate and I'm going to cut that

139
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,639
short

140
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,740
this one is going to be one of the

141
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,200
filament supports this one's going to be

142
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,740
a grid

143
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,740
this is going to be the other filament

144
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,040
support

145
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,480
we're going to do for the one in the

146
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,120
middle is we're going to

147
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,380
cut it off short

148
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,440
just bend it over

149
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,260
and that's what the

150
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,740
wire Arrangement is going to look like

151
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,839
so now we're going to make the grids for

152
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,639
these two tubes

153
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,220
and that's going to be pretty much the

154
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,339
only difference between these two tubes

155
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:06,839
this one's going to be a voltage

156
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,360
amplifier and for that we're going to

157
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,540
space the grid closer together that will

158
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,360
give us a higher voltage gain but less

159
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,040
current will be able to flow through the

160
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,160
tube because the grid itself it

161
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,620
restricts the flow of electrons

162
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,260
so if you have it closer together less

163
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,019
electrons will be able to get through

164
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:29,700
this one's going to be the power

165
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,180
amplifier and we just want a whole bunch

166
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,560
of current to be able to flow through

167
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,180
this

168
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,579
so we're going to space the grid wider

169
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:41,660
apart for that

170
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,860
and for that I'm just going to take this

171
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,399
copper wire

172
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,380
and I'm just going to wind it around

173
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,920
this form right here and maybe do about

174
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,880
like

175
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,560
10 or 11 turns or so

176
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,320
okay here are the finished grids

177
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,079
I went ahead and I crimped some nickel

178
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,860
on the end there

179
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,740
and these are just going to weld on

180
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,160
right there

181
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,959
foreign

182
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,920
for the plates we're going to use this

183
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,620
nickel sheet

184
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,019
and what we're going to do to connect it

185
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,420
the bottom here

186
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,060
we're going to cut off

187
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,639
a strip on each side right here and just

188
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,500
leave a little tab in the middle

189
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,320
that we're going to bend around

190
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,360
that connection right there

191
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,040
so it will all be one piece

192
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,260
foreign

193
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:41,699
and before I weld it

194
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,500
down there I'm going to weld an extra

195
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,199
piece of nickel at the top right here to

196
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:49,040
attach the getter

197
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:00,360
this is going to be the support for the

198
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,279
upper connection to the filament

199
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,319
to keep the filament under tension we

200
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,380
need to put a spring at the top

201
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,559
and we're going to use the 0.24

202
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,760
millimeter tuxton wire for that again

203
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,520
and we're just going to bend this

204
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,459
into sort of a

205
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,160
hook shape

206
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,160
and weld a bit of that on the top to act

207
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,700
as the spring

208
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,160
foreign

209
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,799
now we've got to attach the filament

210
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:52,440
and for that I'm using 0.11 millimeter

211
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,760
tungsten wire

212
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,260
and I just have a little piece of nickel

213
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,780
spot welded on the end

214
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,760
and we just got to fish this through

215
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,740
and weld it on the bottom

216
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,400
okay so now we're going to make the

217
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,419
getter

218
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:22,580
I'm going to use 20 gauge titanium wire

219
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,900
and I'm just going to wind

220
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,260
three Loops of it on here and weld each

221
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,559
one

222
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,140
okay this one is done now we're going to

223
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,400
make an envelope for it

224
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,860
got to make the evacuation stem now

225
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:45,410
[Music]

226
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,179
foreign

227
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,840
foreign

228
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,940
we're going to attach the evacuation

229
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,419
stem

230
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,779
[Music]

231
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,720
okay so we got to cut this to length now

232
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,080
this has got to go in there like that

233
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,419
we have about half inch of extra glass

234
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:22,100
at the bottom we have to get rid of

235
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,640
so what we're going to do is we're going

236
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,460
to score this around

237
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,799
and then we're going to heat up a piece

238
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,780
of glass very hot and just press it

239
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,240
right there where the crack is and

240
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,980
hopefully the crack will

241
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,860
propagate around and it will make us a

242
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,820
relatively clean break

243
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:55,039
thank you

244
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,880
okay let's try to whack it

245
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,000
okay

246
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,600
not quite even but we can just nip that

247
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,520
off with some pliers and that will be

248
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,700
fine while we're at it

249
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,840
I'm gonna take this off

250
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,660
[Music]

251
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,500
[Applause]

252
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,840
okay let's try to give this a test fit

253
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,880
okay so it looks like we're hitting

254
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,659
right there

255
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:11,940
so I'm going to take this to the grinder

256
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,679
and I'm just going to knock a little bit

257
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,700
of glass off there

258
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,539
okay so this

259
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,320
fits in there nicely

260
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,419
so now we're just going to wash it off

261
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:48,380
in some acetone

262
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,240
and then heat it a little bit with the

263
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,940
Torches to drive off the acetone vapor

264
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,340
and then we should be ready to seal that

265
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,940
in this

266
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,460
foreign

267
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,580
let's give it a shot

268
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,400
foreign

269
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,380

[Applause]

272
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:57,900
Okay so we've got the tube on the pump

273
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,480
and I'm gonna check it for leaks using

274
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,900
the high voltage Supply

275
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:13,390
[Music]

276
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:19,679
we have no blue glow at all and that

277
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,059
tells us we have a good seal

278
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:28,690
[Music]

279
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,000
so now what we're going to do is we're

280
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,380
just going to heat this up with the

281
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,740
torch to try to outgass it and once

282
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,960
we've done that for a while we're going

283
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,200
to hook the bombarder up to this to

284
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,080
drive the plate to red heat to try to

285
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,340
outgass that as well

286
00:29:49,620 --> 00:30:01,200
[Music]

287
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,419
okay so I have the tube hooked up to the

288
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:05,640
tube tester and I'm gonna see if I'm

289
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,260
able to

290
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,110
get some life out of it

291
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:25,980
[Music]

292
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,600
yeah looks like we're getting some

293
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,340
France conductance out of it

294
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:50,340
[Music]

295
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,919
okay so we got the tube hooked up to the

296
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:54,480
Bombardier

297
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,539
uh that's this right here this can

298
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:01,799
supply 500 volts up to 200 milliamps but

299
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,500
um we'll probably only get about 25

300
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,000
through this tube but that's still like

301
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,980
about 12 Watts or so

302
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,500
so we'll we'll still get this plate uh

303
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,720
red hot and that will hopefully drive

304
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,950
out any gas frappy in it

305
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:21,809
[Music]

306
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,690
so I'm going to bring that up to

307
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,419
[Music]

308
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,640
500 volts

309
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,559
and I'm going to bring up the filament

310
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,320
voltage

311
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:41,349
[Music]

312
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,620
right now we're only getting about 10

313
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,130
milliamps through there

314
00:31:48,130 --> 00:32:01,410
[Music]

315
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,159
thank you

316
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,659
okay so we can see the plate is starting

317
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:13,919
to glow red

318
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,260
we're passing about 25 milliamps through

319
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,240
the tube

320
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,539
just paying about 12 Watts or so

321
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,580
and I'm just going to let it sit like

322
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,860
this for a few minutes to try to get out

323
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,320
as much gas as I can and then slowly

324
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,120
ramp it back down

325
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,260
[Music]

326
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,659

[Music]

328
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,100
up to the tube tester again

329
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,980
[Music]

330
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,360
looks like it's still working

331
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,460
so I'm just going to heat together a

332
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,140
small amount with the induction heater

333
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,260
just to drive out any last bits of gas

334
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,539
that are trapped into it we'll seal it

335
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:17,880
off and then we'll heat together once

336
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,220
again once it's sealed

337
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:46,339
[Music]

338
00:33:49,250 --> 00:34:00,740
[Music]

339
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,599
foreign

340
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,659
Let's test it

341
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,839
okay so I have the tube hooked up and

342
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,280
let's see if it still works

343
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,060
okay that looks like it's working

344
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,880
so that's adjusting the plate voltage

345
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,500
the grid voltage

346
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,079
and this is adjusting the drive

347
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,660
so that seems to be working

348
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,660
okay let's finish the next one

349
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,400
[Applause]

350
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,460
okay so this is the starting point of

351
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,800
the tube amp so I'm going to build it on

352
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,200
this piece of wood

353
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,720
uh

354
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,420
I have this old uh

355
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,420
tin plated copper wire that I'm going to

356
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,079
use for the connections and uh

357
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,560
just going to use these brass nails for

358
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,780
the posts into the wood

359
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,640
and all the components we need we're

360
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,160
just going to attach them to nails that

361
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,859
are hammered in here so I think I'm just

362
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:27,960
going to start by uh

363
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,960
putting the strips down for the ground

364
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,079
and the high voltage

365
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,240
by pulling the wire like this we can get

366
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,820
it completely straight without any kinks

367
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,060
in it

368
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,980
okay so those are bent

369
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,940
foreign

370
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,859
and I'm just going to use that to get

371
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:13,200
the pattern for the nails and we're

372
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,540
going to put these tubes on

373
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,880
last

374
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,619
because there's other stuff we gotta

375
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:22,140
nail on here and I don't want to subject

376
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:26,720
these to that vibration too much

377
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,000
okay so here's how it's mocked up right

378
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,040
now

379
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,579
I looked through my collection of dog

380
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:43,500
bone resistors

381
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,079
and I was able to pick out a few that I

382
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,260
think will work for this

383
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,000
for the first stage I'm going to use a

384
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,240
1.5 Meg for the input resistor to the

385
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,740
first grid to ground

386
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,680
and then I think I'm going to try to do

387
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:04,740
a 130k plate resistor for the first tube

388
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,540
and then there's also going to be a

389
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,500
choke

390
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,240
in the plate Circuit of this tube

391
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,740
because I find that that increases

392
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,380
volume a little bit

393
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,800
then we're going to have a

394
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,660
435k resistor right here from the second

395
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,119
grid to ground

396
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,700
and then we're using

397
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,040
another one of those Transformers is the

398
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,560
output transformer for this

399
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,380
these have a primary resistance of about

400
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,140
700 ohms and then a secondary resistance

401
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,780
of a few ohms so I hope those will be an

402
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,480
Okay match for these tubes

403
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,500
but uh that will be seen

404
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,060
so I think I'll just start by getting

405
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,859
these uh

406
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:50,540
resistors soldered in there

407
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,339
okay here it is so far

408
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,380
I have these three resistors installed

409
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,859
we also have the schematic right here

410
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:17,160
here are those three resistors

411
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,380
and uh

412
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,820
change the wiring a little bit

413
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,560
previously I was going to wire these

414
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,240
tubes in parallel

415
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,740
but I think it's going to be a better

416
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,720
idea to wire them in series because it

417
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,599
will decrease the current required and

418
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:32,940
we'll also be able to get away with just

419
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,339
having one

420
00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:37,500
variable resistor

421
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,680
for their filament adjustment

422
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,380
is able to find this old

423
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,020
filament riostat

424
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:49,740
it will work pretty good

425
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,280
and as far as these Transformers go I'm

426
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,540
going to use these doorbell Transformers

427
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,160
this one right here is just going to act

428
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,079
like a choke to give us a little bit

429
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,160
more

430
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,940
audio volume on the first stage and I'm

431
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,619
going to use the second one as the audio

432
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:09,660
output Transformer

433
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,260
and uh I can't bring myself to

434
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,560
cut off the prongs right here so we're

435
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,900
just going to mount them on a few pieces

436
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,320
of wood

437
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:26,420
something like that

438
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:39,980
and that should look halfway decent

439
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,780
but

440
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,440
tons

441
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,880
foreign

442
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:55,929
[Music]

443
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,359
foreign

444
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:08,070
[Music]

445
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:46,040
okay here's how it looks so far

446
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,839
unfortunately the tube that was going to

447
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:51,359
be in this position uh

448
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,000
got a pretty hard whack and it ended up

449
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,760
uh breaking the filament so I had to put

450
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,000
in a different tube that I already had

451
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,880
so that's a bit unfortunate

452
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,339
but now we're at the point where we have

453
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:06,900
to get these leads soldered to these

454
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,480
nails and at first I was just going to

455
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,540
bend them around and solder them but uh

456
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,520
that's actually going to be a pretty

457
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,339
tough thing to try to do and undo if I

458
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:18,480
need to swap

459
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,339
tubes in and out

460
00:44:20,339 --> 00:44:23,339
so I have these little uh

461
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:25,920
pieces of brass shim

462
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,760
and I'm gonna cut a slot into them have

463
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,560
a tiny hole in the middle

464
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,220
and basically just slip them

465
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,500
in the middle of each one of these nails

466
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,660
and that will give me sort of a platform

467
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,119
to solder to without having to bend the

468
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:44,460
leads and if I have to unsolder them I

469
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,380
can quickly just heat this up and pull

470
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,160
it back up again

471
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,380
foreign

472
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,420
so I think I'm going to end up just

473
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,060
pulling the nails out

474
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,640
sliding them underneath that might end

475
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,040
up being just as much trouble as cutting

476
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,720
a slot in these

477
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,480
okay so this is how those turned out I

478
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,099
think they look pretty good

479
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:18,180
so the last thing to do is uh

480
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,400
get this control mounted this is going

481
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,780
to be the filament riostat

482
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,720
and then after that we can get the tube

483
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,560
soldered in and start to test this thing

484
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,300
I thought you guys might want a quick

485
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:39,119
look inside this very very old riostat

486
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,579
so I took the cover off

487
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:46,460
and it's actually has uh gearing in it

488
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,920
so here's the resist resistance wire

489
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,480
right here

490
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,200
and then there's a little gear reduction

491
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,339
to give you a fine control over that

492
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:02,579
very very complicated

493
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:05,640
kind of over engineered but pretty

494
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,660
pretty cool looking

495
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,900
so as you can see this control is

496
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,119
missing a lead

497
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,480
so we got to attach something to that I

498
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,160
think I'm gonna

499
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,220
cut off another small piece of brass

500
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,880
for that

501
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,359
Okay so we've got a brass strip right

502
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:32,040
here and we've drilled five holes

503
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,319
through it such that when we solder this

504
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,839
uh the solder is going to have support

505
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:40,220
from both sides of the metal

506
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,579
there's our fixed control

507
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,319
trying to figure out how to mount it

508
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,480
either could take a piece of metal

509
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,880
bend it from here bend it down at an

510
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,920
angle mounted like that or I could do it

511
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,880
with a piece of wood

512
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:17,640
something like that

513
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,040
main issue is going to be trying to have

514
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,240
it

515
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,520
stiff because it's going to be sort of

516
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,400
cantilevered over here and you

517
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,099
try to turn the knob and it could be

518
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:31,020
really weak right here so

519
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,599
that's going to be non-trivial to figure

520
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,579
out

521
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:38,940
okay so for mounting the riostat I'm

522
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,740
going to cut out a piece of brass for

523
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,960
that this is just a

524
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,980
a brass cover that would go on a door

525
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,180
or something like that

526
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,839
and I think I'm just gonna

527
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:58,160
do something like this

528
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,500
I'm gonna do a rough rough shape like

529
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,060
this

530
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:21,020
and

531
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:23,940
once we cut it out we'll make it all

532
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,119
pretty

533
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:45,590
[Music]

534
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:52,380
foreign

535
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,900
foreign

536
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:46,980
got a hollow brass tube that is

537
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,060
sharpened at the end

538
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,119
I'm just gonna punch a hole

539
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,920
and I'm just going to bend the paper

540
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,099
foreign

541
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,300
s the pot

542
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,680
and we're going to use that to make our

543
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,339
Center hole

544
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,520
foreign

545
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,579
okay so for screws I got these

546
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,940
these are not ideal for wood

547
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,520
because they have a fine pitch thread so

548
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,040
probably to get enough grip we might

549
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,020
have to put a little Super Glue on these

550
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:36,599
when we screw these in

551
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:38,520
but that that should be fine no one will

552
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,420
know about that

553
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,619
so I'm just gonna

554
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:46,800
drill two pilot holes here and then

555
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,599
drill them out larger for the screws

556
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,180

557
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,500
foreign

558
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,800
foreign

559
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:26,359
last thing we've got to do

560
00:53:26,819 --> 00:53:28,619
we got to get our coupling caps in there

561
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:31,980
I have a bunch of these old

562
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,440
I think they're Mica caps they might be

563
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,520
paper

564
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,079
I'm gonna have to test them to see if

565
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:38,640
they're leaky

566
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,579
looking through uh my old capacitors I

567
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:44,520
was initially going to go with these it

568
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,520
actually turns out that these are paper

569
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,280
on the inside so like they're they all

570
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,559
test a super leaky

571
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:53,880
um

572
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,059
I was able to find these uh these nice

573
00:53:57,059 --> 00:53:59,099
Mica caps these are really really

574
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:02,280
overkill for this but they're one of the

575
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,740
few old caps I have

576
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:07,140
it's not going to be leaky

577
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:10,140
so I was able to get two of those

578
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:13,700
I'll just put one of them here

579
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,180
one of them here

580
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,640
something like that

581
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,859
and then we can finally call this done

582
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:46,640
okay we have got the tube amp hooked up

583
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,960
here's how it looks all finished up

584
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,420
hooked up to a speaker just a crappy

585
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:57,180
test speaker

586
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,640
the tube tester which will give us our

587
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,200
power

588
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,359
and for the signal Source I'm just using

589
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,579
an AM radio right there

590
00:55:05,579 --> 00:55:09,319
okay let's see what it will do

591
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,470
put it in my ears

592
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:38,839
[Music]

593
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:43,579
of fire roaring at my back

594
00:55:43,579 --> 00:55:46,680
as she disappeared

595
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,640
but soon

596
00:55:51,170 --> 00:56:09,119

[Music]

599
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,859
the way

600
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:05,040
is my story it's sad the truth

601
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:10,579
so as you can see it's not exactly Hi-Fi

602
00:57:10,579 --> 00:57:13,800
I think that's due to uh the the mains

603
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,359
Transformers I'm using right here

604
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:18,420
probably not optimized for audio in any

605
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,280
way uh

606
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:23,220
also if you're doing a single-ended uh

607
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,200
tube amplifier like this you want a

608
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,079
Transformer that has a gap in the core

609
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:30,540
otherwise you can get a saturation in

610
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:33,119
the core and it will add distortion

611
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:36,059
so there is a a number of things uh

612
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:38,460
against us here

613
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:41,579
but you know it sort of works and

614
00:57:41,579 --> 00:57:44,339
that's good enough for me uh pretty much

615
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:49,260
completely scratch Bill tube amplifier

616
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:53,300
kind of unique so that's pretty cool

617
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:57,559
thank you very much for watching
