put it in my ears

[Music]

okay so today we will be showing how to

construct a 1920s style tube amplifier

including

making the tubes for it

this was a really fun project and I

think it turned out really good

so please enjoy

okay so we are going to start the

construction by making the base stems

for the two tubes here's an example

right here

you can see it has copper leads coming

out of the bottom to connect to the tube

and those are spot welded with a tiny

piece of nickel to a piece of tungsten

wire that forms the actual hermetic seal

and then up here there is a piece of

Steel that welds to the tungsten that we

connect to inside the tube

so let's just get started on making that

okay so we have our copper wires here

and we have our strip of nickel and what

we do is we just put this on the end

like that

then we take our cutters

okay so it's now time to weld on our

tungsten wire that's going to make the

actual seal in the glass I'm using 0.24

millimeter tungsten wire

and I just polished that to a mirror

finish using 220 grit sandpaper

and we are just going to weld like a

centimeter or so

to each one of these and cut it off

all right

okay so we're now going to make the top

part that's going to go inside the tube

I have this piece of Steel that I heated

up in the flame to

outgass it I'm just gonna

okay so we got these made now we're

going to weld them on

but first we're going to

just very gently

crimp the ends

just a little bit to put a little flat

spot on there

to make it easier to weld

okay so that's what the electrodes are

going to look like

now we can get started on actual glass

work we're going to have to make the

flare that these pinch into

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

foreign

so we have our two flares

and now we have to expand the glass out

such that we can fit our wires

foreign

foreign

now before we conceal

these wires in the pinches we just made

we have to make a oxide coating on the

surface of the tungsten

in order to create a hermetic seal in

the glass

and to do that we're just going to heat

these in the torch on low heat

and then we're going to clean it off

with a little bit of flux remover and

then we're going to heat it up one more

time just to drive off any remaining

solvent and I've had pretty good luck

with that giving me the correct seal

color

foreign

[Applause]

foreign

[Laughter]

okay that's what it's going to look like

now we just have to seal it in the glass

[Applause]

foreign

[Applause]

foreign

[Music]

[Applause]

okay I'll wait for that to cool and I'll

take a look at the seal color

foreign

okay so I ended up making a few

different seals here's one of them

I just have it in this tube filled with

acetone because it gives us a bit of

magnification so it can get a better

look

and you can see right at the bottom

right here we have the correct seal

color

and that would work you only need a

millimeter or two of that correct golden

color of the tungsten to make a good

seal but it's really not ideal we would

really like to use that entire length of

wire

so I gave it another shot

got this seal

see that one's better use about half the

tungsten this one we use pretty much all

of it that one these are about halfway

up there

like

if you're able to

get the whole length

that's really really what you want to

aim for uh

having the seal that looks like this

with the correct color going all the way

you can be a hundred percent sure that

that's not going to leak whatsoever that

having the text in this correct color is

pretty much the best way to make sure

that you have a good seal through the

glass

okay so we're going to start

constructing the tube elements now

cut these off

so this one on the end is going to be

the plate and I'm going to cut that

short

this one is going to be one of the

filament supports this one's going to be

a grid

this is going to be the other filament

support

we're going to do for the one in the

middle is we're going to

cut it off short

just bend it over

and that's what the

wire Arrangement is going to look like

so now we're going to make the grids for

these two tubes

and that's going to be pretty much the

only difference between these two tubes

this one's going to be a voltage

amplifier and for that we're going to

space the grid closer together that will

give us a higher voltage gain but less

current will be able to flow through the

tube because the grid itself it

restricts the flow of electrons

so if you have it closer together less

electrons will be able to get through

this one's going to be the power

amplifier and we just want a whole bunch

of current to be able to flow through

this

so we're going to space the grid wider

apart for that

and for that I'm just going to take this

copper wire

and I'm just going to wind it around

this form right here and maybe do about

like

10 or 11 turns or so

okay here are the finished grids

I went ahead and I crimped some nickel

on the end there

and these are just going to weld on

right there

foreign

for the plates we're going to use this

nickel sheet

and what we're going to do to connect it

the bottom here

we're going to cut off

a strip on each side right here and just

leave a little tab in the middle

that we're going to bend around

that connection right there

so it will all be one piece

foreign

and before I weld it

down there I'm going to weld an extra

piece of nickel at the top right here to

attach the getter

this is going to be the support for the

upper connection to the filament

to keep the filament under tension we

need to put a spring at the top

and we're going to use the 0.24

millimeter tuxton wire for that again

and we're just going to bend this

into sort of a

hook shape

and weld a bit of that on the top to act

as the spring

foreign

now we've got to attach the filament

and for that I'm using 0.11 millimeter

tungsten wire

and I just have a little piece of nickel

spot welded on the end

and we just got to fish this through

and weld it on the bottom

okay so now we're going to make the

getter

I'm going to use 20 gauge titanium wire

and I'm just going to wind

three Loops of it on here and weld each

one

okay this one is done now we're going to

make an envelope for it

got to make the evacuation stem now

[Music]

foreign

foreign

we're going to attach the evacuation

stem

[Music]

okay so we got to cut this to length now

this has got to go in there like that

we have about half inch of extra glass

at the bottom we have to get rid of

so what we're going to do is we're going

to score this around

and then we're going to heat up a piece

of glass very hot and just press it

right there where the crack is and

hopefully the crack will

propagate around and it will make us a

relatively clean break

thank you

okay let's try to whack it

okay

not quite even but we can just nip that

off with some pliers and that will be

fine while we're at it

I'm gonna take this off

[Music]

[Applause]

okay let's try to give this a test fit

okay so it looks like we're hitting

right there

so I'm going to take this to the grinder

and I'm just going to knock a little bit

of glass off there

okay so this

fits in there nicely

so now we're just going to wash it off

in some acetone

and then heat it a little bit with the

Torches to drive off the acetone vapor

and then we should be ready to seal that

in this

foreign

let's give it a shot

foreign

foreign

foreign

[Applause]

Okay so we've got the tube on the pump

and I'm gonna check it for leaks using

the high voltage Supply

[Music]

we have no blue glow at all and that

tells us we have a good seal

[Music]

so now what we're going to do is we're

just going to heat this up with the

torch to try to outgass it and once

we've done that for a while we're going

to hook the bombarder up to this to

drive the plate to red heat to try to

outgass that as well

[Music]

okay so I have the tube hooked up to the

tube tester and I'm gonna see if I'm

able to

get some life out of it

[Music]

yeah looks like we're getting some

France conductance out of it

[Music]

okay so we got the tube hooked up to the

Bombardier

uh that's this right here this can

supply 500 volts up to 200 milliamps but

um we'll probably only get about 25

through this tube but that's still like

about 12 Watts or so

so we'll we'll still get this plate uh

red hot and that will hopefully drive

out any gas frappy in it

[Music]

so I'm going to bring that up to

[Music]

500 volts

and I'm going to bring up the filament

voltage

[Music]

right now we're only getting about 10

milliamps through there

[Music]

thank you

okay so we can see the plate is starting

to glow red

we're passing about 25 milliamps through

the tube

just paying about 12 Watts or so

and I'm just going to let it sit like

this for a few minutes to try to get out

as much gas as I can and then slowly

ramp it back down

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

up to the tube tester again

[Music]

looks like it's still working

so I'm just going to heat together a

small amount with the induction heater

just to drive out any last bits of gas

that are trapped into it we'll seal it

off and then we'll heat together once

again once it's sealed

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

Let's test it

okay so I have the tube hooked up and

let's see if it still works

okay that looks like it's working

so that's adjusting the plate voltage

the grid voltage

and this is adjusting the drive

so that seems to be working

okay let's finish the next one

[Applause]

okay so this is the starting point of

the tube amp so I'm going to build it on

this piece of wood

uh

I have this old uh

tin plated copper wire that I'm going to

use for the connections and uh

just going to use these brass nails for

the posts into the wood

and all the components we need we're

just going to attach them to nails that

are hammered in here so I think I'm just

going to start by uh

putting the strips down for the ground

and the high voltage

by pulling the wire like this we can get

it completely straight without any kinks

in it

okay so those are bent

foreign

and I'm just going to use that to get

the pattern for the nails and we're

going to put these tubes on

last

because there's other stuff we gotta

nail on here and I don't want to subject

these to that vibration too much

okay so here's how it's mocked up right

now

I looked through my collection of dog

bone resistors

and I was able to pick out a few that I

think will work for this

for the first stage I'm going to use a

1.5 Meg for the input resistor to the

first grid to ground

and then I think I'm going to try to do

a 130k plate resistor for the first tube

and then there's also going to be a

choke

in the plate Circuit of this tube

because I find that that increases

volume a little bit

then we're going to have a

435k resistor right here from the second

grid to ground

and then we're using

another one of those Transformers is the

output transformer for this

these have a primary resistance of about

700 ohms and then a secondary resistance

of a few ohms so I hope those will be an

Okay match for these tubes

but uh that will be seen

so I think I'll just start by getting

these uh

resistors soldered in there

okay here it is so far

I have these three resistors installed

we also have the schematic right here

here are those three resistors

and uh

change the wiring a little bit

previously I was going to wire these

tubes in parallel

but I think it's going to be a better

idea to wire them in series because it

will decrease the current required and

we'll also be able to get away with just

having one

variable resistor

for their filament adjustment

is able to find this old

filament riostat

it will work pretty good

and as far as these Transformers go I'm

going to use these doorbell Transformers

this one right here is just going to act

like a choke to give us a little bit

more

audio volume on the first stage and I'm

going to use the second one as the audio

output Transformer

and uh I can't bring myself to

cut off the prongs right here so we're

just going to mount them on a few pieces

of wood

something like that

and that should look halfway decent

but

tons

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

okay here's how it looks so far

unfortunately the tube that was going to

be in this position uh

got a pretty hard whack and it ended up

uh breaking the filament so I had to put

in a different tube that I already had

so that's a bit unfortunate

but now we're at the point where we have

to get these leads soldered to these

nails and at first I was just going to

bend them around and solder them but uh

that's actually going to be a pretty

tough thing to try to do and undo if I

need to swap

tubes in and out

so I have these little uh

pieces of brass shim

and I'm gonna cut a slot into them have

a tiny hole in the middle

and basically just slip them

in the middle of each one of these nails

and that will give me sort of a platform

to solder to without having to bend the

leads and if I have to unsolder them I

can quickly just heat this up and pull

it back up again

foreign

so I think I'm going to end up just

pulling the nails out

sliding them underneath that might end

up being just as much trouble as cutting

a slot in these

okay so this is how those turned out I

think they look pretty good

so the last thing to do is uh

get this control mounted this is going

to be the filament riostat

and then after that we can get the tube

soldered in and start to test this thing

I thought you guys might want a quick

look inside this very very old riostat

so I took the cover off

and it's actually has uh gearing in it

so here's the resist resistance wire

right here

and then there's a little gear reduction

to give you a fine control over that

very very complicated

kind of over engineered but pretty

pretty cool looking

so as you can see this control is

missing a lead

so we got to attach something to that I

think I'm gonna

cut off another small piece of brass

for that

Okay so we've got a brass strip right

here and we've drilled five holes

through it such that when we solder this

uh the solder is going to have support

from both sides of the metal

there's our fixed control

trying to figure out how to mount it

either could take a piece of metal

bend it from here bend it down at an

angle mounted like that or I could do it

with a piece of wood

something like that

main issue is going to be trying to have

it

stiff because it's going to be sort of

cantilevered over here and you

try to turn the knob and it could be

really weak right here so

that's going to be non-trivial to figure

out

okay so for mounting the riostat I'm

going to cut out a piece of brass for

that this is just a

a brass cover that would go on a door

or something like that

and I think I'm just gonna

do something like this

I'm gonna do a rough rough shape like

this

and

once we cut it out we'll make it all

pretty

[Music]

foreign

foreign

got a hollow brass tube that is

sharpened at the end

I'm just gonna punch a hole

and I'm just going to bend the paper

foreign

s the pot

and we're going to use that to make our

Center hole

foreign

okay so for screws I got these

these are not ideal for wood

because they have a fine pitch thread so

probably to get enough grip we might

have to put a little Super Glue on these

when we screw these in

but that that should be fine no one will

know about that

so I'm just gonna

drill two pilot holes here and then

drill them out larger for the screws

foreign

foreign

foreign

last thing we've got to do

we got to get our coupling caps in there

I have a bunch of these old

I think they're Mica caps they might be

paper

I'm gonna have to test them to see if

they're leaky

looking through uh my old capacitors I

was initially going to go with these it

actually turns out that these are paper

on the inside so like they're they all

test a super leaky

um

I was able to find these uh these nice

Mica caps these are really really

overkill for this but they're one of the

few old caps I have

it's not going to be leaky

so I was able to get two of those

I'll just put one of them here

one of them here

something like that

and then we can finally call this done

okay we have got the tube amp hooked up

here's how it looks all finished up

hooked up to a speaker just a crappy

test speaker

the tube tester which will give us our

power

and for the signal Source I'm just using

an AM radio right there

okay let's see what it will do

put it in my ears

[Music]

of fire roaring at my back

as she disappeared

but soon

[Music]

lips

[Music]

the way

is my story it's sad the truth

so as you can see it's not exactly Hi-Fi

I think that's due to uh the the mains

Transformers I'm using right here

probably not optimized for audio in any

way uh

also if you're doing a single-ended uh

tube amplifier like this you want a

Transformer that has a gap in the core

otherwise you can get a saturation in

the core and it will add distortion

so there is a a number of things uh

against us here

but you know it sort of works and

that's good enough for me uh pretty much

completely scratch Bill tube amplifier

kind of unique so that's pretty cool

thank you very much for watching
